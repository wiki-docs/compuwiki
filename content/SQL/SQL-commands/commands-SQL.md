# SQL commands

SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, encompasses various types of commands for interacting with databases. The key categories include:

- [[DCL]]. Data Control Language
- [[DDL]]. Data Definition Language
- [[DML]]. Data Manipulation Language
- [[DQL]]. Data Query Language
- [[PLC]]. Procedure Language Construct
- [[TCL]]. Transaction Control Language
- [[utility-commands]]

In combination, DDL, DML, and QL (DCL, TCL, utility commands) collectively contribute to the comprehensive set of SQL commands.

Additionally, you can explore [utilty-commands](SQL-syntax/utility-commands.md), which cover other fundamental aspects of SQL. These commands play a crucial role in managing and manipulating data within a database.
